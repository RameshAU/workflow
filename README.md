## Overview

This repository aims to provide a set of reusable and customizable GitHub Actions workflows that can help automate the build, test, and deployment processes. These workflows are intended to save time, improve efficiency, and standardize CI/CD pipelines across projects.

## Workflows

### CI Workflow

The Continuous Integration (CI) workflow is designed to build and test your code automatically when you push to the repository or create a pull request. It ensures that your code is always in a working state.

- **Triggers**: `push`, `pull_request`
- **Jobs**:
  - Install dependencies
  - Run tests
  - Build the project

### Deploy Workflow

The deploy workflow automates the process of deploying your code to your production or staging environment.

- **Triggers**: `push` to the `main` or `production` branch
- **Jobs**:
  - Build the application
  - Deploy to production/staging server

### Other Workflows

This repository may include additional workflows such as:
- Code linting and formatting
- Dependency updates (e.g., using Dependabot)
- Security scanning (e.g., using Snyk or CodeQL)
  
Refer to individual workflow files in the `.github/workflows` directory for more details.
